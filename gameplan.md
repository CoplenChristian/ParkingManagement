# ðŸš€ Presentation Plan â€” Parking Management API Demo

## 1. Introduction & Rapport
- Quick introduction â€” ask the team for their roles to build friendly rapport.
- State:  
  > "Weâ€™re looking forward to working with your team and welcome feedback at any point, so feel free to jump in."
- Ask:  
  > "What are you hoping to get from this demo today so I can be sure to cover every point?"

## 2. Demo â€” API Endpoints

### **Happy Path**
1. Go through each endpoint demonstrating expected behavior.

### **Negative Paths / Error Handling**
- Show how invalid inputs are handled.
- Call out the need for more robust error handling with more time (e.g., some scenarios may not yet be fully covered).

---

## 3. Questions (Mid-Demo)
- Ask for questions or requests for additional scenarios before transitioning to code review.

---

## 4. Code Walkthrough

### **Starting Point**
- Begin with the **Data Seeder** â€” how it populates initial data.

### **In-Memory vs Redis/DB Toggle**
- Future support for multiple instances.
- **Highlight**:
  - Using **ConcurrentHashMap** with atomic actions to prevent race conditions.
  - Why `HashMap` â†’ better lookup performance vs streaming through a list (`HashSet`/`Array`).
  - Current state: single-threaded.
  - Future state: multithreading support.
  - Data structure is **ConcurrentHashMap** to support multithreading & avoid race conditions.
  - Next step: persist data between application starts.
  - Toggle-ready to switch from in-memory to Redis/DB.

## 5. Questions (Post-Code Review)
- Invite questions about the code.
- Offer to show any other classes of interest.

---

## 6. Unit Testing
- Highlight existing unit tests.
- Point out the need for more robust coverage with more time.

---

## 7. AI Usage in Development
- Spinning up code quickly â€” provided design plan, got rapid delivery.
- Researched **ConcurrentHashMap** vs regular **HashMap**, atomic actions for race conditions.
- Helped build a simple demo front-end page.

## 8. With More Time, I Would:
- Create **health check endpoint** for uptime tracking & alerts.
- Enforce **spotNumber uniqueness** (easier with DB + unique constraint).
- Persist data between application startups.
- Improve unit testing.
- Add structured logging for debugging.
- Integrate **SonarQube** or similar for quality/vulnerability scanning.
- Add faster data seeding options (e.g., via API page).
- Optimize `GET all` performance at scale (switch to DB).

## 9. Final Questions & Feedback
- Ask:
  > "Any final questions about how this was implemented or how I presented it?"
- Thank everyone for their time.
